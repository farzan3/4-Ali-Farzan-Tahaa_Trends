# Choose option 2
```

## üìà **MONITORING DATA COLLECTION**

### **Real-time Dashboard:**
- Visit: http://localhost:8501
- Switch to "Live Dashboard" for real-time updates
- Enable "Auto Refresh" to see data as it comes in

### **Database Stats:**
Check current data counts:
```bash
python -c "
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('hunter_app.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM apps')
apps = cursor.fetchone()[0]
cursor.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM steam_games')  
steam = cursor.fetchone()[0]
cursor.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events')
events = cursor.fetchone()[0]
print(f'Apps: {apps:,} | Steam: {steam:,} | Events: {events:,} | Total: {apps+steam+events:,}')
"
```

### **View Recent Collections:**
Check what was scraped recently:
```bash
python -c "
import sqlite3
from datetime import datetime
conn = sqlite3.connect('hunter_app.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute('SELECT title, country, last_updated FROM apps ORDER BY last_updated DESC LIMIT 5')
recent = cursor.fetchall()
print('Recent Apps:')
for i, (title, country, updated) in enumerate(recent, 1):
    print(f'  {i}. {title} ({country}) - {updated[:16]}')
"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT NOTES**

### **Performance Impact:**
- The automated pipeline runs in the background
- Minimal impact on dashboard performance
- Uses respectful delays between API calls

### **Data Storage:**
- Data is stored in SQLite database files
- Database will grow significantly over time
- Old data is automatically cleaned up after 30 days

### **Error Handling:**
- Pipeline automatically retries failed scrapes
- Continues running even if individual scrapers fail
- Check logs in the `logs/` directory for detailed information

### **Stopping the App:**
- Automated scraping stops when you close the enhanced app
- Data already collected remains in the database
- Restart `python start_enhanced.py` to resume automated scraping

## üéâ **SUCCESS INDICATORS**

You'll know the automated scraping is working when:

1. **Dashboard shows increasing numbers** in the metrics
2. **New apps appear** in the "Live Trending Apps" section
3. **Database grows** when you check stats
4. **Recent apps** show current timestamps
5. **Pipeline status** remains "‚úÖ Pipeline Active"

---

## üìû **TROUBLESHOOTING**

**If pipeline shows "‚è∏Ô∏è Pipeline Stopped":**
- Click "‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Pipeline" in the sidebar
- Or restart: `python start_enhanced.py`

**If no new data appears after 2 hours:**
- Check your internet connection
- Check the logs in the `logs/` directory
- Restart the enhanced app

**If you see errors:**
- Most errors are temporary and auto-retry
- Check that all dependencies are installed
- Restart the app if problems persist
